# This file contains descriptions for the blatCoupleR program.
program_short_description : "R-based nucleotide sequence coupler for paired-end sequences aligned by BLAT."

# The following are descriptions of options.
anchorPSL : "Alignment file (psl format) to couple, component of paired-end sequence that is anchored to a biological phenomenon."
adriftPSL : "Alignment file (psl format) to couple, other component of paired-end sequnece that is generated by non-natural forces (shearing)."
keys : "Key files which denote the consolidation of reads to unique sequences. See README for requirements. Mulitple key files should be input in the same order as their respective psl files."
uniqOutput : "Output file for unique alignments. File types supported: .rds, .RData, .csv, and .tsv"
condSites : "Output file for condensed sites, based on anchor alignments. Read counts and unique alignment length counts are reported for each unique site. Same file types supported as uniqOutput."
chimeras : "Output file for chimeric alignments. File type '.rds' only."
multihits : "Output file for multihit alignments. File type '.rds' only."
stat : "File name to be written in output directory of read couts for each sample. CSV file format. ie. test.stat.csv."
refGenome : "Reference genome, needs to be installed through BSgenome (BioConductor)."
maxAlignStart : "Maximum allowable distance from the start of the sequence to keep the alignment. Default = 5."
minPercentIdentity : "Minimal global (whole sequence) percent identity required to keep alignment. Default = 95 (0-100)."
minTempLength : "Minimum value for paired template length to consider. Default = 30 (bps)."
maxTempLength : "Maximum value for paired template length to consider. Default = 2500 (bps)."
keepAltChr : "By default, blatCoupleR will remove alignments from psl files aligning to alternative chromosome, unknown, and random sequences, ex. chr7_*_alt. Using this option will keep these alignments, which may increase multihit outputs."
readNamePattern : "Regular expression for pattern matching read names. Should not contain R1/R2/I1/I2 specific components. Default is [\\w:-]+"
saveImage : "Output file name for saved image. Include '.RData'. ie. debug.RData"
