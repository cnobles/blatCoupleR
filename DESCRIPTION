Title: BLAT alignment joining tool for paired-end reads.
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Christopher Nobles, Ph.D.
Maintainer: Christopher Nobles <cnobles@pennmedicine.upenn.edu>
Description: Tool used for joining, or coupling, paired-end reads after 
    alignment with the BLAST-like Alignment Tool (BLAT). In part, this tool also
    uses good practices when classifying the alignments by grouping joined 
    alignments into either unique alignments, multihit alignments, or chimeric
    alignments.
